**Definition:** The "Proposed" status in the context of Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) indicates that a new architecture decision is under consideration within the project or organization. ADRs in the "Proposed" status represent initial proposals or ideas for addressing specific architectural concerns or requirements, awaiting review, discussion, and validation by stakeholders.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Initiation of Discussion:** ADRs in the "Proposed" status serve as starting points for discussions around potential architecture decisions. They highlight areas of interest or concern within the project and propose tentative solutions or approaches for addressing them.
- **Rationale Exploration:** The "Proposed" status encourages stakeholders to explore the rationale, implications, and trade-offs associated with proposed architecture decisions. It provides a platform for eliciting feedback, gathering insights, and refining initial proposals based on collective expertise and input.
- **Evaluation Criteria:** ADRs in the "Proposed" status may outline evaluation criteria, metrics, or considerations for assessing the viability and desirability of proposed solutions. They provide a basis for objective analysis and comparison of alternative approaches before reaching consensus on the preferred course of action.
- **Iterative Refinement:** The "Proposed" status acknowledges that architecture decision-making is an iterative process, subject to refinement and evolution over time. It encourages an open-minded and collaborative approach to exploring and refining proposed solutions based on emerging insights and feedback.

**Conclusion:** The "Proposed" status in Architecture Decision Records signifies the initiation of discussions around potential architecture decisions within the project. ADRs in this status serve as catalysts for exploration, collaboration, and refinement of proposed solutions, laying the groundwork for informed decision-making and alignment with project objectives. By embracing the "Proposed" status, projects promote transparency, stakeholder engagement, and risk-awareness in architecture-related endeavors, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and innovation.
